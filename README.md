# Welcome gophers !

We are a small group of people interested in the [Go programming language](https://github.com/golang/go), based on a beautiful place called [Galicia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia). Which is located in the Northwest of Spain.

### Motivation

Group all Galicia gophers and just try to make some local community.

### Possible next steps

This repository is some kind of human entrypoint for community proposals, requests and enquiries. We could start modeling this local community together. Like starting a new Go project with an empty `main.go` file ðŸ˜€ . So please don't hesitate on opening a new Issue/PR with your ideas and proposals.
